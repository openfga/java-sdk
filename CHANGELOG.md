# Changelog

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/openfga/java-sdk/compare/v0.8.3...HEAD)

### Added
- feat: RFC 9110 compliant Retry-After header support with exponential backoff and jitter
- feat: Enhanced retry strategy with intelligent delay calculation
- feat: Retry-After header value exposed in error objects for better observability

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Maximum allowable retry count is now enforced at 15 (default remains 3)
- **BREAKING**: FgaError now exposes Retry-After header value via getRetryAfterHeader() method

### Technical Details
- Implements RFC 9110 compliant Retry-After header parsing (supports both integer seconds and HTTP-date formats)
- Adds exponential backoff with jitter (base delay: 2^retryCount * 100ms, capped at 120 seconds)
- Validates Retry-After values between 1-1800 seconds (30 minutes maximum)
- Prioritizes Retry-After header delays over exponential backoff when present
- Unified retry behavior: All requests retry on 429s and 5xx errors (except 501 Not Implemented)

**Migration Guide**: 
- Update error handling code if using FgaError properties - new getRetryAfterHeader() method available
- Note: Maximum allowable retries is now enforced at 15 (validation added to prevent exceeding this limit)

## v0.8.1

### [0.8.1](https://github.com/openfga/java-sdk/compare/v0.8.0...v0.8.1) (2025-02-18)

## v0.8.0

### [0.8.0](https://github.com/openfga/java-sdk/compare/v0.7.2...v0.8.0) (2025-02-07)

- feat!: add support for server-side [`batchCheck`](https://openfga.dev/docs/interacting/relationship-queries#batch-check) method (#141) - thanks @piotrooo!!
  This is a more efficient way to check on multiple tuples than calling the existing client-side `batchCheck`. Using this method requires an OpenFGA [v1.8.0+](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/releases/tag/v1.8.0) server.
    The existing `batchCheck` method has been renamed to `clientBatchCheck`.
    The existing `BatchCheckResponse` has been renamed to `ClientBatchCheckResponse`.
- feat: add support for `start_time` parameter in `ReadChanges` endpoint (#137)

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Usage of the existing `batchCheck` method should now use the `clientBatchCheck` method.

- fix!: reverse the transaction behaviour when `disableTransactions` is set on `Write`
  ⚠️ This is a behavioral breaking change!
  Previously, the `OpenFgaClient` reversed the behavior of write transactions based on the `disableTransactions` flag. This has been fixed so that batched writes are sent if `disableTransactions == true` and a single transactional write if it is false (default).

## v0.0.2

### [0.0.2](https://github.com/openfga/java-sdk/compare/v0.0.1...v0.0.2) (2023-09-15)

The Maven Group ID was updated to `dev.openfga`.

## v0.0.1

### [0.0.1](https://github.com/openfga/java-sdk/releases/tag/v0.0.1) (2023-09-14)

This is an initial beta release. While it can be used to call an FGA server, it lacks conveniences
already present in other OpenFGA SDKs and already planned.

Most notably it lacks a higher-level client (work is in progress), which will be the recommended
entry point.
